# C++ Offscreen Bitmap Drawing

## Origin

This is a fork of http://www.partow.net/downloads/bitmap.zip \
an MIT licensed C++ Bitmap Library from Arash Partow.

See http://www.partow.net/programming/bitmap/index.html
and the referenced documentation there: \
https://www.partow.net/programming/bitmap/documentation/annotated.html


## Purpose

Perform inlined in-memory drawing operations with normal CPU - not using GPU,
which don't need library operations or function calls.
